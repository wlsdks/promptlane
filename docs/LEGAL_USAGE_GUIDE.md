# Legal Usage Guide For Agent Rewrite And Judging

This is an engineering compliance note, not legal advice. It records the public
documentation reviewed on 2026-05-03 and the product boundary chosen for
`promptlane`.

## What The Docs Allow Us To Rely On

- Claude Code hooks include `UserPromptSubmit`, which runs before Claude
  processes a submitted prompt and can add context or block prompt processing.
- Claude Code documents SDK/CLI print mode and structured output formats, but
  Claude legal guidance distinguishes ordinary Claude Code use from third-party
  products routing requests through user credentials.
- Claude Code legal guidance says usage is subject to Anthropic terms and usage
  policy, and says third-party developers building products that interact with
  Claude capabilities should use permitted API-key or cloud-provider
  authentication instead of routing requests through Free/Pro/Max credentials on
  behalf of users.
- Codex CLI is documented by OpenAI as a local coding agent users install and
  run on their own computer.
- OpenAI terms require use according to applicable documentation, prohibit
  credential/key transfer and rate-limit circumvention, and make customers
  responsible for their inputs and outputs.

## Product Boundary

`promptlane` must stay local-first and provider-neutral:

- It does not extract, store, proxy, sell, or reuse Claude.ai OAuth tokens,
  Claude Code internal auth tokens, OpenAI/Codex session tokens, ChatGPT account
  tokens, or provider API keys.
- It does not make hidden background calls to Claude, Codex, OpenAI, Anthropic,
  or other external LLM providers.
- Local deterministic scoring remains the default.
- LLM rewrite and judge behavior is opt-in and agent-mediated. `promptlane`
  can return a bounded, locally redacted prompt packet through MCP so the active
  user-controlled Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI session can rewrite or
  evaluate it. That active agent may send the redacted packet through its
  provider session according to the user's own tool setup, account, and
  approval mode.
- The active agent session can call `record_agent_rewrite` to store a redacted
  improvement draft after user approval. The result must not store the original
  prompt body, raw absolute paths, tokens, or provider credentials.
- The active agent session can then call `record_agent_judgments` to store
  advisory judgment metadata. The stored result must not contain prompt bodies,
  raw absolute paths, tokens, or provider credentials.

## Why This Boundary Was Chosen

The risky design would be for `promptlane` to silently spawn provider CLIs or
route requests through a user's logged-in provider account as a third-party
service. That could blur the line between the user's ordinary use and a product
using provider credentials on the user's behalf.

The implemented design keeps the provider interaction in the user's already
active agent session:

1. The user explicitly asks Claude Code, Codex, or another MCP-capable agent to
   rewrite or judge stored prompts.
2. The agent calls `prepare_agent_rewrite` or `prepare_agent_judge_batch`.
3. `promptlane` returns only bounded metadata and, when requested, locally
   redacted prompt bodies.
4. The active agent rewrites or evaluates the redacted packet in its normal
   user-controlled session.
5. The agent calls `record_agent_rewrite` with the improved draft after user
   approval, or `record_agent_judgments` with scores, confidence, risks, and
   suggestions.
6. `promptlane` stores only redacted rewrite drafts or judgment metadata.

This keeps authentication, model choice, billing, plan restrictions, web search,
and provider policy enforcement inside the user's chosen agent tool rather than
inside `promptlane`.

## Implementation Rules

- Any future provider-call feature must be opt-in, documented, and reviewed
  against provider documentation before release.
- Do not add code that shells out to `claude`, `codex`, or another provider CLI
  for hidden evaluation by default.
- Do not ask users to paste provider tokens into `promptlane`.
- If a future hosted or team feature is added, it must not route requests
  through an individual user's local Claude/Codex credentials.
- Keep the MCP tool descriptions explicit: agent rewrite/judge packets may
  return redacted prompt bodies, while local score/archive tools must not return
  stored prompt bodies.
- Treat LLM judge results as advisory. Do not replace deterministic local scores
  or privacy-safe benchmark gates with an external judge result.
