## 1. Purpose

Phase 2 expands `promptlane` from a safe local prompt archive into a local-first prompt memory and improvement workspace.

The product should help users:

- operate capture/export policy per project
- import old prompt history safely
- understand weak prompt habits
- rewrite the next prompt more clearly
- export anonymized data without leaking raw local identifiers

This document is an implementation PRD, not a business KPI document. Completion is judged by feature behavior, privacy boundaries, recovery behavior, tests, browser checks, and release smoke.

## 2. Baseline Before Phase 2

The baseline already included:

- Claude Code/Codex prompt capture
- fail-open hooks
- setup, doctor, server, service, and statusline commands
- Markdown archive
- SQLite/FTS index
- hard delete
- `rebuild-index`
- CLI list/search/show/delete/open
- web list/detail/dashboard/settings
- local session cookie and CSRF protection
- local rule-based analysis preview
- checklist, tags, quality gaps, and suggestions
- copy/bookmark/reuse signals
- exact duplicate detection
- release smoke and pack dry-run

## 3. Phase 2 Core Scope

Phase 2 core is limited to:

1. Project Control Plane
2. Transcript Import
3. Prompt Improvement Workspace
4. Import execution/resume hardening
5. Anonymized Export
6. Benchmark/browser/release regression coverage

External LLM analysis and tool-assisted analysis are not Phase 2 core. Later
agent-mediated judge workflows must stay explicit, opt-in, redacted, and outside
the local deterministic score.

## 4. Product Principles

- Preserve local-first defaults.
- Keep external transmission disabled.
- Apply project policy consistently to capture, import, export, and future analysis.
- Use preview or dry-run before risky operations.
- Never damage existing Markdown/SQLite data during import/export.
- Run generated drafts through redaction before storage.
- Do not automatically edit `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or project settings.
- Do not automatically replace or resubmit prompts into Claude Code/Codex.

## 5. Shared Security And API Requirements

- All Phase 2 browser APIs require app access.
- All mutations and preview job creation routes require CSRF protection.
- Ingest bearer tokens are not accepted for management APIs.
- Problem details, audit events, and browser responses must not include raw prompts, raw secrets, provider API keys, tokens, or raw import payloads.
- Browser project/prompt surfaces must not expose raw paths by default.
- Provider responses, rewrite drafts, instruction candidates, and imported transcript text are untrusted content.
- UI rendering must reuse the sanitizer/CSP boundary.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` suggestions are copy-only unless a future explicit write flow is added.

## 6. Project Control Plane

Goal:

- let users inspect and control project-level capture/export/analysis boundaries

Implemented capabilities:

- project list API
- project policy update API
- project policy web UI
- `capture_disabled`
- `export_disabled`
- stored/displayed `analysis_disabled`
- stored/displayed `retention_candidate_days`
- stored/displayed `external_analysis_opt_in`
- policy audit events
- raw path masking on browser surfaces

Acceptance criteria:

- policy mutation requires app access and CSRF
- project API responses do not include tokens, raw prompts, raw secrets, or raw transcript paths
- capture-disabled projects do not persist new prompt ingest
- capture-disabled known projects skip matching import candidates
- export candidate selection respects export-disabled policy
- policy audit events are raw-free

## 7. Transcript Import

Goal:

- allow users to bring historical prompt records into the local archive safely

Implemented capabilities:

- `promptlane import --dry-run`
- `promptlane import --save-job`
- `promptlane import --execute`
- `promptlane import --resume`
- `promptlane import-job`
- raw-free import job summaries
- malformed record tolerance
- assistant/tool/unsupported role skip
- large line skip
- idempotency key
- `import_records`
- imported-only filters

Acceptance criteria:

- dry-run does not create prompt Markdown, prompt index rows, or FTS rows
- executed import redacts before storage
- one malformed record does not stop the whole import
- assistant/tool output is not stored as user prompt content
- imported prompts appear in list/search/detail/dashboard flows
- imported-only filters work

Public beta boundary:

- import is CLI-centered
- web import upload UI is not implemented

## 8. Prompt Improvement Workspace

Goal:

- help users turn weak prompts into clearer next requests

Implemented capabilities:

- `promptlane improve`
- `local-rules-v1` improvement generation
- prompt detail improvement panel
- copy improvement draft
- save improvement draft
- latest draft retrieval
- draft cleanup on prompt delete
- Benchmark v1 coach metric

Acceptance criteria:

- drafts do not overwrite source prompts
- drafts pass through redaction before storage
- raw secrets are not reintroduced
- copy/save interactions work in web UI
- prompt deletion removes related drafts

Public beta boundary:

- no automatic resubmission into Claude Code/Codex
- no hidden external LLM judge or rewrite provider

## 9. Anonymized Export

Goal:

- let users inspect and export a privacy-preserving review dataset

Implemented capabilities:

- CLI anonymized preview/job flow
- web anonymized preview/execution
- raw-free `export_jobs`
- `job_id` execution
- included/excluded field summary
- sensitive count
- residual identifier count
- small-set warning
- preview invalidation
- JSON copy/download UI

Acceptance criteria:

- export jobs store no raw prompt ids, raw paths, raw cwd, or raw secrets
- export result contains masked prompts and anonymized metadata
- deleted prompts are excluded
- policy/redaction/count changes invalidate stale preview jobs
- browser UI does not expose raw export

Public beta boundary:

- raw export is not implemented

## 10. External Or Tool-Assisted Analysis Appendix

External LLM analysis is excluded from Phase 2 core.

After Phase 2, `promptlane` may expose explicit MCP handoff tools that return
bounded redacted packets to the active user-controlled Claude Code/Codex session
for advisory judgment. That is not a hidden provider integration, and it must
not extract provider tokens, proxy credentials, or replace local deterministic
scores.

This includes calling installed tools such as Claude Code or Codex as analysis executors. That may avoid storing a separate provider API key, but the payload can still leave the local machine through the user's tool account. It is not local-only.

Any future gated beta must require:

- global opt-in
- project opt-in
- prompt-level preview
- redaction preview
- provider/model/command disclosure
- timeout and cost boundaries
- audit events
- no automatic project file writes
- no automatic `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` writes

## 11. Implemented Storage Additions

Phase 2 adds or relies on:

- `project_policies`
- `policy_audit_events`
- `import_jobs`
- `import_records`
- `import_errors`
- `prompt_improvement_drafts`
- `export_jobs`

## 12. Verification Gates

Required:

- unit and storage tests for new data contracts
- API tests for auth/CSRF/privacy behavior
- browser E2E for archive/detail/coach/projects/export/mobile
- privacy regression fixture
- Benchmark v1
- release smoke
- pack dry-run

## 13. Final Status

PRD2 core is complete. The remaining work is release-oriented:

- English/Korean public README documentation
- release notes
- beta tag and npm publish decision
- Node 22/24 CI gate
- cross-platform smoke expansion
- beta feedback loop for PromptLane quality
