# Release Checklist

Use this checklist before publishing a public beta or npm package.

## Scope

- [ ] README describes install, init, server, hook install, doctor, uninstall, and delete flows.
- [ ] README states the default storage path.
- [ ] README states that local rule-based analysis preview is implemented.
- [ ] README states that PromptLane improvement drafts are copy-based and do not auto-type, replace, or resubmit prompts into Claude Code or Codex.
- [ ] Prompt Rewrite Guard docs state that `block-and-copy` is opt-in and requires manual paste/enter.
- [ ] README states that transcript import is CLI-centered and has no web upload UI.
- [ ] README states that browser export is anonymized-only and raw export is not implemented.
- [ ] README documents Benchmark v1 as a local regression baseline, not a real-user quality proof.
- [ ] README states that hidden external LLM/provider calls are disabled by
  default, and optional MCP agent-judge packets require explicit user request.
- [ ] README includes a non-affiliation notice for Anthropic and OpenAI.
- [ ] Codex is clearly labeled beta.
- [ ] Adapter guide is up to date.
- [ ] Security policy is up to date.

Confirm `corepack pnpm pack:dry-run` uses the local wrapper:

- [ ] wrapper strips pnpm-only npm env before `npm pack`
- [ ] wrapper runs `npm pack --dry-run --ignore-scripts` after build

Confirm `corepack pnpm pack:dry-run` excludes:

- [ ] no `dist/**/*.map` files (source maps stay local-only)
- [ ] no `src/`, `node_modules/`, `coverage/`, `tests/`, `.github/`

## Security Regression

- [ ] Raw detected secrets are absent from Markdown under `mask` mode.
- [ ] Raw detected secrets are absent from SQLite prompt rows and FTS search results under `mask` mode.
- [ ] Raw prompt-body absolute paths are redacted from Markdown, SQLite, FTS, browser prompt APIs, export surfaces, import job summaries, and hook stdout/stderr.
- [ ] npm publish tokens (`npm_<36+ char>`) are masked in the privacy regression fixture across the same surfaces.
- [ ] `/api/v1/health` does not return `data_dir` or any raw filesystem path.
- [ ] Hook wrappers record `last_ingest_status` even when `postPayload` throws, so `doctor` can surface the failure.
- [ ] Adapter idempotency keys normalize the upstream `session_id` before hashing (Claude Code parity with Codex).
- [ ] Invalid payload values are not echoed in error responses.
- [ ] Hook wrappers fail open and do not write prompt text to stdout/stderr.
- [ ] Browser state-changing requests require same-origin session and CSRF protection.
- [ ] Ingest routes require bearer auth.
- [ ] Host, Origin, and cross-site browser request checks are enforced.
- [ ] Delete removes Markdown, prompt row, FTS row, redaction events, and related prompt metadata.
- [ ] Anonymized export jobs are invalidated when previewed prompt membership, deletion state, project policy versions, redaction version, or preview counts change.

## PRD2 Feature Regression

- [ ] Project list and policy toggle work in the web UI without exposing raw project paths.
- [ ] `capture_disabled` project policy blocks new ingest for that project.
- [ ] `capture_disabled` project policy skips matching import candidates for known projects.
- [ ] `prompt-coach import --dry-run --save-job` stores a raw-free job summary.
- [ ] `prompt-coach import --execute` imports prompt candidates and supports resume/idempotency.
- [ ] Imported-only filter works in CLI/API list flows.
- [ ] Prompt detail shows local analysis and a PromptLane improvement draft.
- [ ] PromptLane improvement drafts can be copied and saved without overwriting the original prompt.
- [ ] Export preview and execute work from both CLI and web UI.
- [ ] Benchmark v1 passes with `privacy_leak_count` equal to 0.
- [ ] Browser E2E passes on desktop and mobile viewport checks.

## CI

- [ ] Node 22 CI passes.
- [ ] Node 24 CI passes.
- [ ] `better-sqlite3` opens a database and supports WAL/FTS5 in CI.
- [ ] Platform support notes are accurate for the release.

## Manual Smoke

`corepack pnpm smoke:release` automates the core local smoke path below with an isolated temporary data directory and HOME.

- [ ] `prompt-coach init`
- [ ] `prompt-coach server`
- [ ] `prompt-coach install-hook claude-code --dry-run`
- [ ] `prompt-coach install-hook codex --dry-run`
- [ ] Capture one fixture-like Claude Code prompt.
- [ ] Capture one fixture-like Codex prompt.
- [ ] Confirm both prompts appear in CLI.
- [ ] Confirm both prompts appear in the web UI.
- [ ] Confirm PromptLane improvement draft copy/save works in the web UI.
- [ ] Confirm anonymized export preview and execution work.
- [ ] Confirm Benchmark v1 passes.
- [ ] Delete a prompt and confirm it disappears from CLI and web UI.

## Deferred For Non-CI Local Beta

These items are recommended before a broader public release, but can be deferred for a local-only beta when explicitly documented in release notes:

- [ ] Cross-platform GitHub Actions matrix for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- [ ] `better-sqlite3` install/open/WAL/FTS5 smoke on each supported release platform.
