# Architecture Decision Records

Lightweight ADRs for `prompt-coach`. Each file captures the context behind a
structural decision so a future architecture review does not have to
re-discover the same friction signals.

Format:

- `Status`: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded by NNNN, or Rejected.
- `Date`: ISO date the ADR was last updated.
- `Tracks`: optional pointer to the workstream that produced the ADR.
- Sections: Context, Friction signals, Considered options, Recommendation,
  Decision.
