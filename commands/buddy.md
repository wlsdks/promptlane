# PromptLane Buddy

Use this when the user wants an always-on prompt score companion while working
inside Claude Code.

Claude Code cannot open a persistent right-side plugin panel from this command.
Instead, instruct the user to open a second terminal pane beside Claude Code and
run:

```sh
promptlane buddy
```

For a one-shot check inside this conversation, run:

```sh
promptlane buddy --once
```

For machine-readable output, run:

```sh
promptlane buddy --json
```

Also mention the optional Claude Code status line if they want a compact HUD:

```sh
promptlane install-statusline claude-code
promptlane statusline claude-code
```

If another Claude Code HUD already exists, explain that promptlane chains
the existing command and restores it on uninstall where possible.

Do not print raw prompt bodies, raw hook payloads, raw absolute paths, tokens,
or secrets. Explain that the buddy is local-only, reads the promptlane
archive, and never auto-submits improved prompts.
