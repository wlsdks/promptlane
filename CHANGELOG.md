# Changelog

All notable changes to promptlane will be documented in this file.

The format follows a simple reverse-chronological release log.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-08

This is the first stable public release. The release covers local capture, storage,
search, deletion, prompt analysis, project policy, transcript import,
anonymized export, PromptLane drafts, Prompt Practice workspace, MCP scoring
tools, benchmark/release validation, and an English/Korean web UI.

### Added

#### Setup and capture

- `promptlane setup`, `promptlane init`, `promptlane doctor`,
  `promptlane hook`, `promptlane install-hook`/`uninstall-hook`,
  `promptlane statusline`/`install-statusline`/`uninstall-statusline`,
  and `promptlane service` for guided local installation and diagnostics.
- `setup --profile coach` to register a low-friction rewrite guidance profile
  through hook context, with a Claude Code status line installed when
  Claude Code is detected.
- `setup --register-mcp` to register `promptlane mcp` with detected
  Claude Code and/or Codex CLIs.
- `promptlane start --open-web` to launch the local server and open the
  web workspace on a new agent session.
- Claude Code hook wrapper, settings install, and doctor checks.
- Codex beta hook adapter, install, and doctor checks.
- `promptlane buddy` for hook diagnostics during a live session.

#### Storage and recovery

- Markdown source-of-truth archive with SQLite/FTS search index.
- Hard delete across Markdown, DB rows, FTS, events, and drafts.
- `promptlane rebuild-index` to reconstruct the SQLite index from the
  Markdown archive.
- Project quality profiles persisted in SQLite.
- Reused-prompt focus, duplicate prompt candidate detection, and
  local prompt usefulness tracking.

#### Web UI

- Archive list with prompt snippets, active filter bar, tool/project/tag/
  quality-gap/imported-only filters, and prompt focus filters.
- Prompt detail view with analysis preview, improvement draft, agent follow-up
  commands, queue navigation, gap drilldown, and return action.
- Quality dashboard with metric drilldown, distribution drilldown, trend, and
  trend day drilldown.
- Project policy screen with capture/export/analysis/retention/external-analysis
  fields and audit events.
- Agent command center and vertical status line surfaces.
- Anonymized export preview and execution UI with included/excluded field
  summary, sensitive count, residual identifier count, and small-set warning.
- English/Korean language switch.

#### PromptLane and Prompt Practice

- Local rule-based analysis preview (`local-rules-v1`) and checklist.
- `promptlane improve` and `promptlane coach` commands.
- Approval-based PromptLane with copy/save improvement draft, latest-saved
  draft fetch, and related-draft cleanup on prompt deletion.
- Coach follow-up commands and recommended next agent action.
- Prompt Practice workspace with one-click builder, fixed-draft copy action,
  score history, and outcome feedback that does not store draft text.

#### Import and export

- `promptlane import` with `--dry-run`, `--save-job`, `--execute`,
  `--resume`, and `promptlane import-job` for transcript import jobs.
- Capture-disabled project import skip and imported-only filtering.
- `promptlane export --anonymized` with `--preview` and `--job` for
  raw-free anonymized export.

#### MCP and agent workflows

- Local stdio MCP server (`promptlane mcp`) with prompt scoring tools.
- `promptlane loop outcome` for recording a privacy-validated result on the
  latest or selected snapshot before proposing or approving durable memory.
- Selected-worktree outcome recording in the web Loops view, with CSRF,
  write-time privacy validation, and no automatic memory approval.
- Exact snapshot and worktree/session/branch memory candidate and approval
  selection across CLI, MCP, and web without global-latest fallback.
- Agent prompt wrappers, agent-assisted rewrite workflow, and
  agent-mediated judge tools for explicit redacted-packet handoff.
- Prompt rewrite guard that prevents silent prompt resubmission.
- Prompt rewrite guard `ask` mode that asks the user one or two clarifying
  questions before answering. On Claude Code this uses the native
  `AskUserQuestion` tool; on Codex it calls the `ask_clarifying_questions`
  MCP tool with a native OS dialog fallback (osascript / zenity / PowerShell
  InputBox).
- Local-only telemetry of when the rewrite guard fires `ask`
  (`tool`, `score`, `band`, `missing_axes`, `language`, `prompt_length`),
  stored in `prompt_ask_events` and surfaced through a 7-day **Ask mode**
  panel on the dashboard so the trigger gate (`length ≥ 30`, `score < 60`,
  not an acknowledgment) can be tuned against real usage.

#### Validation and packaging

- Installed `promptlane benchmark` command with synthetic/real fixture
  selection and an explicit operator-owned `--fixture-file` path for local,
  consent-bearing redacted effectiveness signals, plus no-overwrite
  `benchmark init-fixture` setup for the shipped private-permission template.
  Generated and shipped templates now remain non-runnable until the operator
  replaces every example and explicitly sets `template_only` to `false`.
  Real benchmark runs now derive effectiveness only from operator-confirmed
  outcome metadata; prompt-only corpora remain explicitly unproven.
  Real score delivery no longer depends on synthetic vague-prompt/spread
  fixtures, and actual passed outcomes are measured as `outcome_pass_rate`.
  Real evidence now stays a snapshot until `--baseline-file` compares the same
  raw-free corpus fingerprint and reports material metric deltas.
- Local benchmark v1 with privacy, retrieval, coach, analytics, and latency
  thresholds (`pnpm benchmark`, `pnpm benchmark -- --json`).
- Browser E2E smoke covering archive, detail, coach, projects, export, and
  mobile overflow (`pnpm e2e:browser`).
- Local release smoke harness (`pnpm smoke:release`) covering isolated build,
  CLI, server, storage, web, rebuild, delete, import, and export.
- Claude Code and Codex marketplace plugin packaging.
- English and Korean README, full feature audit, release readiness docs,
  marketplace install guide, package contents check, and pre-publish privacy
  audit.
- Vitest gate enforcing that `src/shared/version.ts` `VERSION` matches
  `package.json#version`, so a one-sided release bump fails locally.
- General PR/main test CI and scheduled UI patrol workflows are removed. The
  local release gate is the authoritative release and merge signal:
  `corepack pnpm format`, `corepack pnpm test`, `corepack pnpm lint`,
  `corepack pnpm build`, `corepack pnpm pack:dry-run`,
  `corepack pnpm --silent benchmark -- --json`, browser E2E, release/package
  smoke, complete quality evidence, and `git diff --check`.

#### Korean coverage end-to-end

- `local-rules-v1` analyzer recognizes Korean prompt signals across goal,
  background, scope, output, verification, and product tags.
- `improvePrompt` auto-detects Korean inputs by Hangul ratio and renders
  Korean section headers, copy, and safety notes.
- `score_prompt_archive` returns Korean practice plan, gap rule labels,
  and next-prompt template when `language: "ko"` is set.
- `coach_prompt` and `promptlane coach --language ko` forward the
  language argument all the way through the archive call.
- Hook rewrite-guard emits Korean block/context messages for Korean
  prompts; web UI auto-detects Korean from `navigator.language` on first
  visit.

#### Coach explanation surfaces

- Web prompt detail shows per-criterion `earned/weight` next to each
  checklist item so the score is no longer a single opaque number.
- `promptlane show <id> --explain` renders the same per-axis breakdown
  on the terminal.
- MCP `score_prompt` already returns the breakdown; the plugin doc now
  describes it explicitly so agents can relay the per-axis explanation.

### Changed

- npm tarball excludes `dist/**/*.map` source maps (~75 files,
  ~1 MB unpacked) — local dev still builds them.
- list/search human output now prefixes a count and warns when the
  result is capped by `--limit` or the FTS 8-token cap.
- Web API errors include the HTTP status and the server's problem
  detail instead of a bare label.
- Many CLI/MCP/hook errors now end with a working example or a next
  command (import dry-run/execute, export preset, prompts open,
  doctor last-ingest, MCP score/improve/rewrite/judge empty paths,
  pm-\* wrapper `--pc-help`).

### Changed

- Activation flow simplified so that `setup --profile coach` covers MCP
  registration and the status line in one step instead of separate commands.
- Web app, prompt detail, prompt practice, and habit coach panel split into
  component-owned modules and CSS so that `App.tsx` and the global
  stylesheet do not accumulate per-screen logic.
- MCP tool contracts split into definitions, types, handler orchestration, and
  JSON-RPC routing so that adding a tool does not touch one large file.
- Storage boundaries clarified between query/transaction, row contracts, and
  defensive JSON decoding.
- Solo-maintainer PR rules documented so that stable release merges no longer
  require an external approving review while remaining gated on Node 22 and
  Node 24 CI plus resolved conversations.
- Prompt-memory product identity statement aligned across docs, CLI help,
  setup output, and Coach surface text.

### Fixed

- Installed Claude Code and Codex hooks now use a stable absolute CLI path
  so that hook execution survives `npm`/`pnpm` global path differences.
- Existing Claude Code status line commands are preserved and chained when
  the promptlane status line is installed, and restored on uninstall.
- Multiline Claude Code status line output is preserved instead of being
  collapsed to a single line.
- Web filter controls now have stable accessible names so that screen
  reader and automated UI checks do not collide on duplicate labels.
- `/api/v1/health` no longer returns the local `data_dir` absolute path.
- Hook wrapper records a failed `last_ingest_status` entry even when
  the post-to-server call throws, so `doctor` can surface the failure
  with the next-step hint added in the same release.
- Claude Code adapter normalizes `session_id` before hashing it into
  the idempotency key, matching Codex behavior.
- `promptlane open <id>` validates the id before printing a URL,
  matching `show`/`delete`. The `runImportDryRun` ENOENT now produces
  a friendly message that does not echo the resolved local path.

### Security

- Local-only server binding by default.
- Hook ingest bearer token stored locally; same-origin session cookie and
  CSRF protection for browser writes.
- Best-effort redaction before Markdown, SQLite, and FTS storage in mask mode,
  including explicit secret assignments, Google API keys, and npm publish
  tokens (`npm_<36+>`).
- Browser/export raw path masking; export job snapshots do not store raw
  prompt ids, raw cwd, raw paths, or raw secrets.
- Privacy regression checks for Markdown, SQLite, FTS, browser APIs, import
  jobs, export jobs, hook output, and npm publish tokens across every
  surface.
- PromptLane output redaction hardened so that improvement drafts and
  follow-up commands do not leak prompt body, raw paths, or tokens.
- Agent judge / MCP rewrite handoff is opt-in and routes through the user's
  active Claude Code/Codex/Gemini CLI session; promptlane does not extract
  or proxy provider credentials and does not call external LLMs from its own
  process.
- Pre-publish privacy audit grep mirrors the live detector list so a
  reviewer running the documented command catches the same token shapes
  the runtime redactor masks.
